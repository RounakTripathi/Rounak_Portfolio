        description: " I developed a Booking Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to register, log in,and book services such as hotels, events, or appointments in real time. As the lead developer, I was responsible for designing the backend RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, implementing secure user authentication with JWT, and integrating a MongoDB database for storing user, booking, and service information. On the frontend, I built a responsive and dynamic user interface using React.js, implementing features like service listings, booking forms, and user dashboards. I also used state management with React Context API and ensured seamless API integration with Axios. Through this project, I gained in-depth experience in full-stack development, handling both client-side and server-side logic, database operations, and real-time user interaction.",
